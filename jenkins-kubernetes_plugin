Environment running:- My Jenkins master is running in the EC2 instance. Jenkins version:- Jenkins 2.249.1

My Kubernetes cluster is running in EKS

I have installed the Kubernetes plugin(1.27.7) and trying to create a Jenkins agent in k8's. I have created a service account, role, role binding. My Yaml file looks as below.

apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: jenkins-admin
  namespace: default
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: jenkins
  namespace: default
  labels:
    "app.kubernetes.io/name": 'jenkins'
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["create","delete","get","list","patch","update","watch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods/exec"]
  verbs: ["create","delete","get","list","patch","update","watch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods/log"]
  verbs: ["get","list","watch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: jenkins-role-binding
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: jenkins
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: jenkins-admin
  namespace: default
In Place of the default namespace, I have given a specific namespace
